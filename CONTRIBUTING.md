## 🚀 Unleash Your Creativity

You are free to implement **anything useful** to the project. We want Twin-Messenger to be the best nostalgic experience possible.

### What can I work on?

1.  **Make "Placeholders" Functional:**
    You might have noticed several buttons in the app (like **"Community"**, **"Invite"**, **"Fonts"**, or **"Emoticons"**) that currently show an alert saying *"Function not available"*.
    * **Goal:** Make them work! Feel free to write the backend and frontend logic to activate these features.

2.  **Add New Features:**
    Don't limit yourself to what you see.
    * Want to add **File Sharing**? Go ahead.
    * Want to implement **Voice Notes**? Do it.
    * Want to create **Custom Themes**? We'd love to see it.

    If you find an error, help us squash it.
